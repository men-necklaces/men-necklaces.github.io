In ancient Rome, the wearing of pearls was a clear marker of social status, with Julius Caesar himself known to wear them. Only the elite could afford such luxurious ornaments, underscoring the pearl's association with wealth and power. The pearl's symbolic significance continues through history. Medieval knights often carried pearls into battle, believing them to possess protective properties, transforming the pearl into a talisman.
